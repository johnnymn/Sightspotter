# Sightspotter

This app allows you to find places around you using AR. It fetches the data for
nearby places from the Wikipedia API. It was implemented using ARKit and
SpriteKit.

## Usage

After granting camera and location permissions the landmarks will appear as
labels on the AR view.

## Setup

CocoaPods is used to manage the external dependencies. The `Pods/` folder is
versioned, so you can clone the repo, open the `Sightspotter.xcworkspace` and
everything should work.
